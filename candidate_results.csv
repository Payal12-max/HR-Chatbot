payal sulaniya,payalshhhh1414@gmail.com,Software Engineer,"**Technical Aspect:** Can you describe a time when you had to solve a particularly challenging coding problem? What was your approach, and how did you arrive at the solution?","While building a resume parser, I struggled with accurately extracting and classifying sections from varied formats. I used regular expressions combined with a rule-based NLP approach, refining it with feedback. This improved parsing accuracy and consistency significantly.",8,"**Situational Aspect:** Imagine you've been assigned to a project with a tight deadline, but you realize that the requirements are unclear and conflicting. How would you handle this situation to ensure the project's success?","I initiated a quick sync with stakeholders to clarify unclear points, documented key decisions, and highlighted conflicts early. Then I prioritized core features to deliver a basic working version on time while planning refinements for future iterations.",9,**Behavioral Aspect:** Tell us about a time when you had to work with a difficult team member. How did you manage to maintain a positive working relationship and achieve your project goals?,"A teammate often dismissed others' suggestions. I focused on active listening, encouraged open dialogue during standups, and acknowledged their strengths. Gradually, we built mutual respect, and collaboration improved, resulting in a smooth delivery.",8,"**Unique Angle - Open Source Contribution:** Are you involved in any open-source projects? If so, which ones and how have you contributed? If not, would you be interested in contributing to open-source projects, and why or why not?","I'm not actively contributing yet, but I’m very interested. I follow open-source projects on GitHub, especially in AI and developer tools. I plan to start with documentation or bug fixes to learn and give back to the community.",7,"**Unique Angle - Continuous Learning:** As a software engineer, it's essential to stay updated with the latest technologies and trends. Can you share some recent technologies or programming languages you've explored and how you've integrated them into your work or personal projects?","Recently, I explored LangChain and Streamlit to build an AI-powered HR chatbot. I integrated OpenAI’s API, added email alerts, and created a custom UI. This helped me understand real-time LLM application development and deployment.",9,8.2,Selected
